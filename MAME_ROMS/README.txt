ibm5100.zip is the Tom Stepleton extracted ROS that was done around 2019.  Please lookup the story on the incredible OCR approach he conducted to do this.  His original .bin files have been re-arranged into individual ROS files as needed by the MAME emulator.

ibm5110.zip is the Christian Corti extracted ROS that was done somewhere around 2005-2009 (unsure of exact year).  He used an incredibly clever approach of "steering" the startup address lines, taking advantage of a startup nuance unique to these IBM systems (where the ROS memory content can be viewed in hex for one cycle, using the STEP-MODE switch).  Similar as above, his original binaries have been re-arranged into individual files (the filenames correspond to what slot the ROS code was installed in).
                                                                                                                                                        In both cases, this approach applied to the System ROS.  The "NX" (non-executable) ROS containing the BASIC and APL emulated code are extracted in a different way, where these modules are in devices whose content can be copied to RWS (main memory) and exported to a file (making them far easier to extract, but are in that same category of being a "stored on a chip" ROS content).
                                                                                                                                                        Likewise, in both cases the display ROS could not be extracted.  The display ROS just contains the font symbol set.  A guess was made on what this arrangement looked like, then refined over a few iterations to dial in what looks to be an accurate reconstruction of the original font of both systems.
                                                                                                                                                        Note that for the IBM 5110, we also had to guess/approximate what we believe to be the correct pitch for its BEEP speaker.  We did this by me making a recording of the real IBM 5110 emitting a beep (by forcing an error at the BASIC prompt).  I tried using an app to measure the frequency, and Patrick made his best guess also from what he heard on the video and the measured frequency.  I think we got reasonably close approximation to the original pitch.
